        "\n",
        "In this second notebook on sequence-to-sequence models using PyTorch and TorchText, we'll be implementing the model from [Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078). This model will achieve improved test perplexity whilst only using a single layer RNN in both the encoder and the decoder.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's remind ourselves of the general encoder-decoder model.\n",
        "\n",
        "![](assets/seq2seq1.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "We use our encoder (green) over the embedded source sequence (yellow) to create a context vector (red). We then use that context vector with the decoder (blue) and a linear layer (purple) to generate the target sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous model, we used an multi-layered LSTM as the encoder and decoder.\n",
        "\n",
        "![](assets/seq2seq4.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "One downside of the previous model is that the decoder is trying to cram lots of information into the hidden states. Whilst decoding, the hidden state will need to contain information about the whole of the source sequence, as well as all of the tokens have been decoded so far. By alleviating some of this information compression, we can create a better model!\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll also be using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) instead of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). Why? Mainly because that's what they did in the paper (this paper also introduced GRUs) and also because we used LSTMs last time. To understand how GRUs (and LSTMs) differ from standard RNNS, check out [this](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) link. Is a GRU better than an LSTM? [Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555) has shown they're pretty much the same, and both are better than standard RNNs. \n",

        "We'll be coding up the models in PyTorch and using torchtext to help us do all of the pre-processing required. We'll also be using spaCy to assist in the tokenization of the data. Install spaCy tokenizers for English and German. "

The linear layer will take $d(y_t), s_t$ and $z$ also by concatenating them together, hence the input dimensions are now `emb_dim + hid_dim*2`. We also don't pass a value of dropout to the GRU as it only uses a single layer.\n",
